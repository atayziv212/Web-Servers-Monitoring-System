# Web-Servers-Monitoring-System
1. First, it should be noted that the code was written in a Windows operating system - if you want to run it in a different operating system such as macOs, you must change the Back-Slashes in the code.
2. Download the zip file and open it in the work environment that is convenient for you (the work environment must be able to run javascript code)
3. When you are in the project folder, type "node ./server.js" in the terminal.

Additional highlights:
-I used the Postgres SQL system, download the file webserversDbDump.sql and the file requestdbDump.sql and set them up in your database.
-On the Postman website, you must import the file Operational_Postman_File
for simulates the API Methods created.
